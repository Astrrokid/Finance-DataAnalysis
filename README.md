# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical stock data of several financial institutions including Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC). The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the stock market trends and the performance of these companies over time.

## Data Source
The stock data is retrieved using the `pandas_datareader` library from the Stooq database. The data spans from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2016, providing a comprehensive historical perspective on the stock prices and trading volumes of the selected companies.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas_datareader
- pandas
- numpy
- datetime

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Retrieval: Stock data is retrieved for each company using the pandas_datareader library.
2. Data Exploration: Basic exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure, features, and summary statistics.
3. Data Cleaning: Any missing or inconsistent data is addressed through data cleaning techniques.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots are used to analyze the trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.

## Files Included
- Finance_Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data retrieval, exploration, and analysis.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
